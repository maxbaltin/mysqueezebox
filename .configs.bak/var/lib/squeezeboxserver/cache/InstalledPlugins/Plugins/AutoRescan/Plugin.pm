# This is a plugin to provide automatic rescanning of music files as they are
# changed within the filesystem. It depends on the 'inotify' kernel function
# within Linux and, therefore, currently only works when used on a Linux system
# where that kernel feature has been enabled. See the INSTALL file for further
# instructions on the kernel configuration.
