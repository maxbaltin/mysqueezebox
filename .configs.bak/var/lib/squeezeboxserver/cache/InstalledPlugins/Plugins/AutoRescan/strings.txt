SETUP_PLUGIN_AUTORESCAN_DELAY_DESC
	EN	This setting controls the amount of time after a change is detected that a rescan of the modified folders will be performed. It doesn't matter if multiple files are being copied, or that the copy may take longer than this time, since the plugin will perform another rescan if additional changes were made. This setting therefore just helps to avoid more scans than necessary and can be safely left at the default.

SETUP_PLUGIN_AUTORESCAN_SCRIPT_DESC
	EN	This setting allows you to specify a script that will be executed at the same time that the plugin triggers a rescan of the music library. Note that this script will be executed within the main SqueezeCenter server thread and so you need to bear in mind a) that the script will run with the same privilege as SqueezeCenter (be careful) and b) if the script does not return quickly then SqueezeCenter will hang while the script runs (and music may stutter). Leave this setting empty if you don't want to execute a script when rescanning.
