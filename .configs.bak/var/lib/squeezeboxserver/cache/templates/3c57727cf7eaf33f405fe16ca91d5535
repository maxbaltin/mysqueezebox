    $output .=  "\n\n<h4>Introduction</h4>\n<p>The Logitech Media Server software includes native support for the xPL home automation protocol.\nxPL is an open standard, intended to permit the control and monitoring of devices throughout the home.\nThe purpose of xPL is to provide an efficient, unified \nmechanism for devices to communicate with each other, and with an intelligent house manager.\nThis approach leads to a truly integrated home, and makes it very \neasy to accomplish tasks which in the past would have required custom programming skills.\nThere is xPL support for a growing list of hardware, including the popular X10 home automation \nmodules.\n</p>\n\n<h4>xPL Messages</h4>\n<p>xPL messages are text-based, and are sent on UDP port 3865.  Messages \nare broadcast to all nodes on the network using the Ethernet broadcast address,\nallowing xPL-enabled applications, such as an intelligent house manager, to listen\nto all xPL messages and take appropriate action.</p>\n\n<p>The complete <a href=\"http://www.xplproject.org.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=1&page=1\" target=\"_blank\">xPL Protocol Specification</a> \ncan be found on the <a href=\"http://www.xplproject.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Official xPL Project Site</a>, and\nis recommended reading for anyone who is interested in using the xPL protocol to greatest advantage.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Enabling xPL Support in the server</h4>\n<p>To enable xPL support, go to Server Settings -&gt; Additional Server Settings -&gt; Network.<br>\nScroll to the xPL section, and set xPL support to Enabled.<br>\nClick Change, then restart your server software.\n</p>\n<p>Once enabled, each player that is connected to the server (including software players) will generate an xPL heartbeat message, \nalerting other nodes on the network of it's presence.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Starting an xPL Hub</h4>\n<p>To allow multiple xPL applications to run simultaniously on the same host, it is necessary to run an xPL Hub. The Hub handles all incoming xPL messages and distributes them to all xPL-enabled applications that are running\non the local machine. There are many different hub implementations available for a variety of platforms\nincluding Windows and Linux. See the xPL Project Site for a complete list.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Controlling the server via xPL</h4>\n<p>You can control the server by sending xPL messages, either to all devices, or targetted at a particular player.\nThere are a number of ways of sending an xPL message - see the xPL Project Site for a list of\napplications that support xPL, and for a variety of command-line tools.\n</p>\n<p>The server can be controlled using four different types of xPL message.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xplproject.org.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=6&page=1\" target=\"_blank\">\naudio.basic</a> messages can be used to provide basic control of the server. This includes functions common to all audio players, such as play, stop, volume etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xplproject.org.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=32&page=1\" target=\"_blank\">\naudio.slimserv</a> messages are used to harness the more advanced features of the server, performing any of the commands that can be performed\nvia the command-line interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xplproject.org.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=13&page=1\" target=\"_blank\">\nremote.basic</a> messages are used to control the server by simulating button presses on a remote control,\nin a similar way to the &quot;button&quot; command in the command-line interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xplproject.org.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=8&page=1\" target=\"_blank\">\nosd.basic</a> messages are used to display text on a players screen.</p>\n\n<h4>Logitech Media Server Status Messages</h4>\n<p>Each player that is connected to the server will send out a heartbeat message as soon as it connects,\nand at intervals of between 5 and 30 minutes thereafter. The heartbeat message includes\ninformation about the player, such as the player's mode (playing, paused or stopped),\nthe name of the song that is currently playing, and the text that is\ncurrently displayed on the player's screen.<br>\nYou can request this information at any time by sending an audio.request message\nto the player you wish to query. Each player will also send out a status message each time a track changes, when the end of a playlist is reached and when the unit it switched on/off.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Infra-red Remote Control Messages</h4>\n<p>When buttons are pressed on a player's remote control, it is possible to have xPL messages generated to inform\nother nodes on your network, e.g. to fire macros in your home automation software.<br>\nOperation of this feature can be controlled either via the Web interface (Server Settings -&gt; Additional Server Settings -&gt; Network), or remotely by an xPL configuration manager.<br>\nThe following values are supported:<br>\n<i>None</i> : No xPL message will be sent when a button is pressed.<br>\n<i>Buttons</i> : An xPL message will be sent when a recognised button code is \nreceived, and the name of the button will be included.<br>\n<i>Raw</i> : All infra-red codes that the player can receive will cause an xPL message to be sent.\nThe message will contain the raw hex value of the infra-red code. This allows the player to be used as a general purpose infra-red receiver.<br>\n<i>Both</i> : This is a combination of <i>Buttons</i> and <i>Raw</i>. The player will send an xPL message for every remote control signal it receives, including the raw hex codes. It will also send messages when recognised buttons are pressed, including the name of the button.\nUsers should be aware that this configuration will result in two messages being transmitted for recognised button codes - one containing the hex value, and one containing the recognised button name.\n</p>\n\n\n\n";
