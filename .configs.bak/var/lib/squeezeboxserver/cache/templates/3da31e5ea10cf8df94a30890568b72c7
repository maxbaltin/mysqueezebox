For further\n    information scroll down to <a href=\"#songvariables\" class=\"browseItemLink\">Filenames based on song variables</a>.\n   </li> \n </ul>\n  \n<h4>How do I get cover art?</h4>\n<p>Many sites that sell CDs include cover art in their catalog. With most browsers, you can right click on the image and select \"Save image as...\"</p>\n<h4>Useful plugins</h4>\n<p>Several third party developers have written utilities to automatically retreive cover art based on the internal tags of your MP3, Ogg, Flac, or other files. See \n<a href=\"http://forums.slimdevices.com/forumdisplay.php?4-3rd-Party-Software\" target=\"_new\" class=\"browseItemLink\"\n>3rd-Party-Software</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h4>Find albums with small /missing artwork used in your library:</h4>\n <p>The Music Artist Info plugin can support you to find albums with no or small artwork.\n    If you enabled this plugin before a scan/rescan - it supports you with some additional Information under the extras in the main menue.\n </p>\n \n<h4>Artwork file requirements</h4>\n<p>The Squeezebox supports .GIF .PNG and .JPG files.</p>\n\n<h4>Image sizes</h4>\n <p>The image files should be modest in size, as they are sized to fit on the HTML browser window or the device's display.\n A good size nowadays is a maximum of about 1500x1500. This should display reasonably well even on high resolution displays.\n Please keep in mind that the larger the file is, the longer it will take to process.</p>\n\n<h4>Technical details</h4>\n <p>For each place in the skin that references a cover art image, the Squeezebox software performs the following search:</p>\n\n <p>Search in the current music directory for (in order):</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>cover.jpg, cover.gif\n   <li>folder.jpg, folder.gif\n   <li>album.jpg, album.gif\n  </ul>\n\n <p>The Logitech Media Server will use the first image file located in this search.</p>\n \n<h4 id=\"songvariables\">Filenames based on song variables</h4>\n <p>If your first character is %, the server then parses the rest of the string as an InfoFormat, the same as title format is created. As an example, you could create a single directory of songs and name all your artwork as artist-album.jpg.  For this, enter a setting of</p> \n<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;%ARTIST-ALBUM.jpg</pre> \n <p>for Artwork or Artwork Thumbnail in the server settings section.</p>\n\n <p>Available data elements are:</p> \n  <table>\n   <tbody>\n    <tr>\n     <td><b>Setting </td>\n     <td>Description </b></td>\n    </tr>                 \n    <tr>\n     <td>CT</td>\n     <td>content type</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>TITLE</td>\n     <td>Song title</td>\n    </tr>\n     <td>GENRE</td>\n     <td>Song genre</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>TRACKNUM</td>\n     <td>tracknumber as an integer</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>FS</td>\n     <td>file size as reported by the underlying Operating System.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>ARTIST</td>\n     <td>Artist for pop music, sometimes conductor for classical works.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>ALBUM</td>\n     <td>Album name</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>COMMENT</td>\n     <td>Often the encoder used to create the MP3/FLAC/AAC/... file.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>YEAR</td>\n     <td>Year published or released.</td>\n    </tr> \n    <tr>\n     <td>SECS</td>\n     <td>total song length in seconds</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>DURATION</td>\n     <td>(minutes and seconds)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>VBR_SCALE</td>\n     <td>vbr/cbr</td>\n    </tr>  \n    <tr>\n     <td>BITRATE</td>\n     <td>encoded bit rate</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>VOLUME</td>\n     <td>volume name</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>   \n     <td>PATH</td>\n     <td>Path to the song</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n     <td>FILE</td>\n     <td>main file name of song</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>EXT</td>\n     <td>file extension of song (Type in Microsoft systems)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>  \n     <td>LONGDATE</td>\n     <td>current date, long</td> \n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n     <td>SHORTDATE</td>\n     <td>current date, short</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>   \n     <td>CURRTIME</td>\n     <td>current time.</td>\n    </tr>\n   </tbody> \n  </table>\n<p>Elements can be separated by anything (or nothing).

If an Artwork Folder setting is used (in Server Settings, Additional, Interface) then that folder is searched first\nfor any file matching those given for Artwork.\n</p>\n\n";
