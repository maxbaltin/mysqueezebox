(Replace \"localhost\" with the IP address of the remote computer.)\n  This will inform the server that the software player is ready to receive a stream.\n <li>Open the web interface of the server running on the remote computer by opening the web page <a href=\"/\">\"http://localhost:9000\"</a> (Replace \"localhost\" with the IP address of the remote computer). You will notice\n   a \"player\" corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player.\n <li>Use the left pane of the server web interface to browse and select files and playlists. When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface. \n <li>Click on \"Play\" in the right pane of the server web interface to start the music.\n <li>After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.) \n <li>If the MP3 Player did not start playing - please press the Play button on the MP3 Device again.\n <li>To change the content playing, use the server on the remote machine.\n</ul>\n<h2>Password security:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n <li>If you are using the server's password security, you'll need to\n         use a slightly modified URL like this:\n         http://username:password\@localhost:9000/stream.mp3 \n <li>If the password securtiy for Logitech Media Server Software is\n          enabled - Please use only your own Devices or delete the History.\n          Otherwise your Account credentials become public. \n</ul>\n\n<h2>Advanced Features:</h2>\n<ul>\n <li>Your music can also be streamed to a Squeezebox or Transporter\n           network music player for listening on a stereo.\n <li>To use all features like Volume Control Logitech Media Server\n            you need a device that supports the squeezeboxprotokoll like\n            Squeezebox Classic, Squeezebox Boom, Squeezebox Duet,\n            Transporter, Squeezebox Radio, Squeezebox Touch,\n            squeezelite.\n</ul>             \n\n<div>\n<br/>\n <p>For more information about this product and FAQs, visit  <a\n href=\"http://www.mysqueezebox.com/support\">www.mysqueezebox.com</a></p>\n \n <p>If you have a question or problem, please visit www.mysqueezebox.com/support or visit our user forums at <a\n href=\"http://forums.slimdevices.com/\">http://forums.slimdevices.com/</a></p>\n</div>\n              \n";
